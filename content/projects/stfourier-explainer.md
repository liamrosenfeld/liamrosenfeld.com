blurb: "My WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge submission"
---

My WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge submission. It guides you along the creation of multiple live views that all utilize the Short Time Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse. The goal of the playground is to guide the user along a path of learning in the fields of both programming and digital signal processing.
