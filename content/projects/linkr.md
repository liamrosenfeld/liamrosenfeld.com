A modern self-hosted URL Shortener for both individuals and organizations that’s easy to set up and use.

Before this project, I had been learning Rust but wanted to start a full project with it. Around that time, I was looking through self-hosted URL shorteners and found that they all had convoluted setup process that were problematic for any non-developer. I decided to try to make my own to both do a project in Rust and to fill that gap.

I first planned the setup user experience and then worked backwards. Fortunately, Rust using Rocket fit in. Rocket is a younger project so there isn't as many resources out yet; however, they greatly make up for that in a helpful community.

There are still more features to add, but the project has a fully functional and solid foundation.
