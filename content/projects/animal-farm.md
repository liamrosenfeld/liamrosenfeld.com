A Discord bot that sends custom animal ASCII art messages. (I just really like coding ascii art generators).

I initially wrote the bot in python for a repl.it challenge, though I decided to rewrite it in Swift as I kept adding features because I find it a much more maintainable language.

The project was my first introduction to running code on a server, which presented a set of new challenges. I ended up with running it in a Docker container on Heroku.
