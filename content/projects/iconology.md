blurb: "A macOS app for creating app icons"
---

This project started off simple: I was tired of exporting every Xcode icon size so I made a small mac app to do it. It quickly grew into a fully fledged mac app including both numerously more export types along with a smalls suite of image editing tools. Watching the app grow taught me a lot about the long term implications of architecture decisions.
