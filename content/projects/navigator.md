blurb: "An improved bus app for the Gainesville RTS"
---

NaviGator is a mobile app I built with my friend Jonathan. It's a greatly improved bus tracker for the Gainesville RTS, built to be responsive and designed as a good platform citizen. I largely focused on the live map (built with MapKit) and data fetching.

In the year after launch, it got over 20k downloads, has over 5k daily active users, and during peak usage hours has over 600 concurrent users.
