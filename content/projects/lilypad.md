blurb: "A text-based visual code editor architected to supported multiple languages and platforms"
---

Lilypad is a new text-based visual code editor intended to bring the benefits of block based and dual modal editors to a fully text based editing experience. I am leading the research team within the Engaging Learning Laboratory under Dr. Blanchard. Research is still ongoing on its impacts.

The editor is built in Rust and targets running as a native app, a VSCode extension, and in the browser (the later two running via web assembly).

I am the first author for showpiece paper in the 2023 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing. It is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10305659).
