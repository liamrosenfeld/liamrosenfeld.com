about:
  content: "I'm currently studying computer engineering and mathematics at the University of Florida and interned on Productivity Apps at Apple. I have a passion for computing, math, and music. I especially enjoy exploring their crossroadsâ€”wherever they may lie. My favorite programming languages are Swift and Rust and I typically work on native apps for Apple platforms along with embedded development. I am also an Apple WWDC19 and WWDC20 Scholar."
