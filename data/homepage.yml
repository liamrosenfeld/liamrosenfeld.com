about:
  content: "I'm a student studying computer science at the University of Florida with a passion for development, music, and making things. I like exploring the crossroads of programing, math, and music wherever they may lie. My favorite programming languages are Swift and Rust, though I primarily work in Swift (and occasionally web technologies—such as this site). I am also an Apple WWDC19 and WWDC20 Scholar."
